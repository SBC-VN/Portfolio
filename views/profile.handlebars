        <strong>Website Summary</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
            This website / profile is a product of my ongoing practice of keeping current with what's
            going on with software.   The ability to create browser based 'light' GUIs was missing from 
            my repertoire, so I jumped into a Full Stack Web Development course to correct that.
